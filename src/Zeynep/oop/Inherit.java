    What is inheritance?
       it is a part of OOP concept, it helps to get all fields and methods in SuperClass to the SubClass
       also called parent-child relationship

    why do I need to use it?
       for code reusibility
       for method overriding

    what is the syntax of inheritance?
       extends
       super()


    follow like that use public field, than private (for private use getter/setter or constructor)
